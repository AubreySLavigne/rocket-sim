# Rocket Simulation

This is intended to be a basic physics simulation for the purpose of simulating orbital mechanics and gravity on a solar system scale.

I have the idea of gamifying this simulation, either as a "realistic" combat simulator, or to simulate communication over large distances.  Potential idea to integrate with termui to provide an "old-school" display with minimal information
